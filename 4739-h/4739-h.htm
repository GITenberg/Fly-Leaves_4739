1</span>MORNING.</h2>
<p class="poetry">&rsquo;<span class="smcap">Tis</span> the hour
when white-horsed Day<br />
Chases Night her mares away;<br />
When the Gates of Dawn (they say)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ph&oelig;bus opes:<br />
And I gather that the Queen<br />
May be uniformly seen,<br />
Should the weather be serene,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On the slopes.</p>
<p class="poetry">When the ploughman, as he goes<br />
Leathern-gaitered o&rsquo;er the snows,<br />
From his hat and from his nose<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Knocks the ice;<br />
<a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>And the
panes are frosted o&rsquo;er,<br />
And the lawn is crisp and hoar,<br />
As has been observed before<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Once or twice.</p>
<p class="poetry">When arrayed in breastplate red<br />
Sings the robin, for his bread,<br />
On the elmtree that hath shed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Every leaf;<br />
While, within, the frost benumbs<br />
The still sleepy schoolboy&rsquo;s thumbs,<br />
And in consequence his sums<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Come to grief.</p>
<p class="poetry">But when breakfast-time hath come,<br />
And he&rsquo;s crunching crust and crumb,<br />
He&rsquo;ll no longer look a glum<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Little dunce;<br />
<a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>But be brisk
as bees that settle<br />
On a summer rose&rsquo;s petal:<br />
Wherefore, Polly, put the kettle<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On at once.</p>
<h2><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>EVENING.</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Kate</span>! if e&rsquo;er
thy light foot lingers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On the lawn, when up the fells<br />
Steals the Dark, and fairy fingers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Close unseen the pimpernels:<br />
When, his thighs with sweetness laden,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From the meadow comes the bee,<br />
And the lover and the maiden<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Stand beneath the trysting tree:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">Lingers on, till stars unnumber&rsquo;d<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tremble in the breeze-swept tarn,<br />
And the bat that all day slumber&rsquo;d<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Flits about the lonely barn;<br />
<a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>And the
shapes that shrink from garish<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Noon are peopling cairn and lea;<br />
And thy sire is almost bearish<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If kept waiting for his tea:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">And the screech-owl scares the peasant<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As he skirts some churchyard drear;<br />
And the goblins whisper pleasant<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tales in Miss Rossetti&rsquo;s ear;<br />
Importuning her in strangest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sweetest tones to buy their fruits:&mdash;<br />
O be careful that thou changest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On returning home, thy boots.</p>
<h2><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>SHELTER.</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">By</span> the wide
lake&rsquo;s margin I mark&rsquo;d her lie&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The wide, weird lake where the alders sigh&mdash;<br
/>
A young fair thing, with a shy, soft eye;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And I deem&rsquo;d that her thoughts had flown<br />
To her home, and her brethren, and sisters dear,<br />
As she lay there watching the dark, deep mere,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All motionless, all alone.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then I heard a noise, as of men and boys,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And a boisterous troop drew nigh.<br />
Whither now will retreat those fairy feet?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where hide till the storm pass by?<br />
<a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>One
glance&mdash;the wild glance of a hunted thing&mdash;<br />
She cast behind her; she gave one spring;<br />
And there follow&rsquo;d a splash and a broadening ring<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On the lake where the alders sigh.</p>
<p class="poetry">She had gone from the ken of ungentle men!<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet scarce did I mourn for that;<br />
For I knew she was safe in her own home then,<br />
And, the danger past, would appear again,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For she was a water-rat.</p>
<h2><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>IN THE
GLOAMING.</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">In</span> the Gloaming to
be roaming, where the crested waves are foaming,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the shy mermaidens combing locks that ripple to
their feet;<br />
When the Gloaming is, I never made the ghost of an endeavour<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; To discover&mdash;but whatever were the hour, it
would be sweet.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;To their feet,&rdquo; I say, for
Leech&rsquo;s sketch indisputably teaches<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That the mermaids of our beaches do not end in ugly
tails,<br />
<a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>Nor have
homes among the corals; but are shod with neat balmorals,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; An arrangement no one quarrels with, as many might
with scales.</p>
<p class="poetry">Sweet to roam beneath a shady cliff, of course
with some young lady,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lalage, Ne&aelig;ra, Haidee, or Elaine, or Mary
Ann:<br />
Love, you dear delusive dream, you!&nbsp; Very sweet your victims
deem you,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When, heard only by the seamew, they talk all the
stuff one can.</p>
<p class="poetry">Sweet to haste, a licensed lover, to Miss
Pinkerton the glover,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Having managed to discover what is dear
Ne&aelig;ra&rsquo;s &ldquo;size&rdquo;:<br />
<a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>P&rsquo;raps to touch that wrist so slender, as your
tiny gift you tender,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And to read you&rsquo;re no offender, in those
laughing hazel eyes.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then to hear her call you &ldquo;Harry,&rdquo;
when she makes you fetch and carry&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O young men about to marry, what a blessed thing it
is!<br />
To be photograph&rsquo;d&mdash;together&mdash;cased in pretty
Russia leather&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hear her gravely doubting whether they have spoilt
your honest phiz!</p>
<p class="poetry">Then to bring your plighted fair one first a
ring&mdash;a rich and rare one&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Next a bracelet, if she&rsquo;ll wear one, and a
heap of things beside;<br />
<a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>And
serenely bending o&rsquo;er her, to inquire if it would bore
her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To say when her own adorer may aspire to call her
bride!</p>
<p class="poetry">Then, the days of courtship over, with your
WIFE to start for Dover<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or Dieppe&mdash;and live in clover evermore,
whate&rsquo;er befalls:<br />
For I&rsquo;ve read in many a novel that, unless they&rsquo;ve
souls that grovel,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Folks <i>prefer</i> in fact a hovel to your dreary
marble halls:</p>
<p class="poetry">To sit, happy married lovers; Phillis trifling
with a plover&rsquo;s<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Egg, while Corydon uncovers with a grace the Sally
Lunn,<br />
<a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>Or
dissects the lucky pheasant&mdash;that, I think, were passing
pleasant;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As I sit alone at present, dreaming darkly of a
Dun.</p>
<h2><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>THE
PALACE.</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">They</span> come, they
come, with fife and drum,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And gleaming pikes and glancing banners:<br />
Though the eyes flash, the lips are dumb;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To talk in rank would not be manners.<br />
Onward they stride, as Britons can;<br />
The ladies following in the Van.</p>
<p class="poetry">Who, who be these that tramp in threes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through sumptuous Piccadilly, through<br />
The roaring Strand, and stand at ease<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At last &rsquo;neath shadowy Waterloo?<br />
Some gallant Guild, I ween, are they;<br />
Taking their annual holiday.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>To catch the destin&rsquo;d train&mdash;to pay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their willing fares, and plunge within it&mdash;<br
/>
Is, as in old Romaunt they say,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With them the work of half-a-minute.<br />
Then off they&rsquo;re whirl&rsquo;d, with songs and shouting,<br
/>
To cedared Sydenham for their outing.</p>
<p class="poetry">I mark&rsquo;d them light, with faces bright<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; As pansies or a new coin&rsquo;d florin,<br />
And up the sunless stair take flight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Close-pack&rsquo;d as rabbits in a warren.<br />
Honour the Brave, who in that stress<br />
Still trod not upon Beauty&rsquo;s dress!</p>
<p class="poetry">Kerchief in hand I saw them stand;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In every kerchief lurk&rsquo;d a lunch;<br />
When they unfurl&rsquo;d them, it was grand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To watch bronzed men and maidens crunch<br />
The sounding celery-stick, or ram<br />
The knife into the blushing ham.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>Dash&rsquo;d the bold fork through pies of pork;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;er hard-boil&rsquo;d eggs the saltspoon
shook;<br />
Leapt from its lair the playful cork:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet some there were, to whom the brook<br />
Seem&rsquo;d sweetest beverage, and for meat<br />
They chose the red root of the beet.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then many a song, some rather long,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Came quivering up from girlish throats;<br />
And one young man he came out strong,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And gave &ldquo;The Wolf&rdquo; without his
notes.<br />
While they who knew not song or ballad<br />
Still munch&rsquo;d, approvingly, their salad.</p>
<p class="poetry">But ah! what bard could sing how hard,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The artless banquet o&rsquo;er, they ran<br />
Down the soft slope with daisies starr&rsquo;d<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And kingcups! onward, maid with man,<br />
They flew, to scale the breezy swing,<br />
Or court frank kisses in the ring.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>Such are the sylvan scenes that thrill<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This heart!&nbsp; The lawns, the happy shade,<br />
Where matrons, whom the sunbeams grill,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Stir with slow spoon their lemonade;<br />
And maidens flirt (no extra charge)<br />
In comfort at the fountain&rsquo;s marge!</p>
<p class="poetry">Others may praise the &ldquo;grand
displays&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where &ldquo;fiery arch,&rdquo;
&ldquo;cascade,&rdquo; and &ldquo;comet,&rdquo;<br />
Set the whole garden in a &ldquo;blaze&rdquo;!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Far, at such times, may I be from it;<br />
Though then the public may be &ldquo;lost<br />
In wonder&rdquo; at a trifling cost.</p>
<p class="poetry">Fann&rsquo;d by the breeze, to puff at ease<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; My faithful pipe is all I crave:<br />
And if folks rave about the &ldquo;trees<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lit up by fireworks,&rdquo; let them rave.<br />
Your monster f&ecirc;tes, I like not these;<br />
Though they bring grist to the lessees.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Alone beside Caermarthen Bay.</p>
<p class="poetry">He felt the salt spray on his lips;<br />

Thou hast trotted o&rsquo;er many a mile to-day,<br />
And I trow right meagre hath been thy fare<br />
Since they roused thee at dawn from thy straw-piled lair,<br />
To tread with those echoless unshod feet<br />
Yon weltering flats in the noontide heat,<br />
Where no palmtree proffers a kindly shade<br />
And the eye never rests on a cool grass blade;<br />
And lank is thy flank, and thy frequent cough<br />
Oh! it goes to my heart&mdash;but away, friend, off!</p>

As thou standest now, on thy Native Strand,<br />

And thy nostril upturn&rsquo;d to the od&rsquo;rous air,<br />
Would not woo thee to pause till his skill might trace<br />
At leisure the lines of that eager face;<br />
The collarless neck and the coal-black paws<br />
And the bit grasp&rsquo;d tight in the massive jaws;<br />
The delicate curve of the legs, that seem<br />
Too slight for their burden&mdash;and, O, the gleam<br />
Of that eye, so sombre and yet so gay!<br />
Still away, my lithe Arab, once more away!</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nay, tempt me not, Arab,
again to stay;<br />
Since I crave neither Echo nor Fun to-day.<br />
For thy <i>hand</i> is not Echoless&mdash;there they are<br />
Fun, Glowworm, and Echo, and Evening Star:<br />
And thou hintest withal that thou fain would&rsquo;st shine,<br

There is brass on thy brow, and thy swarthy hues<br />
Are due not to nature but handling shoes;<br />
And the hit in thy mouth, I regret to see,<br />
Is a bit of tobacco-pipe&mdash;Flee, child, flee!</p>

<p class="poetry">I <span class="smcap">watch&rsquo;d</span> her
as she stoop&rsquo;d to pluck<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A wildflower in her hair to twine;<br />
And wish&rsquo;d that it had been my luck<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To call her mine.</p>
<p class="poetry">Anon I heard her rate with mad<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Mad words her babe within its cot;<br />
And felt particularly glad<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That it had not.</p>
<p class="poetry">I knew (such subtle brains have men)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That she was uttering what she shouldn&rsquo;t;<br

And thought that I would chide, and then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought I wouldn&rsquo;t:</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

&nbsp;&nbsp; Those pouting coral lips, and chided?<br />
A Rhadamanthus, in my place,<br />

<p class="poetry">For ire wherewith our bosoms glow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is chain&rsquo;d there oft by Beauty&rsquo;s

&nbsp;&nbsp; Still mute&mdash;(O brothers, was it sin?)&mdash;<br

I drank, unutterably moved,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her beauty in:</p>
<p class="poetry">And to myself I murmur&rsquo;d low,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As on her upturn&rsquo;d face and dress<br />
The moonlight fell, &ldquo;Would she say No,<br />

<p class="poetry"><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A finish&rsquo;d coon.</p>
<p class="poetry">But when she caught adroitly up<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And soothed with smiles her little daughter;<br />
And gave it, if I&rsquo;m right, a sup<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of barley-water;</p>
<p class="poetry">And, crooning still the strange sweet lore<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; Which only mothers&rsquo; tongues can utter,<br />
Snow&rsquo;d with deft hand the sugar o&rsquo;er<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its bread and butter;</p>
<p class="poetry">And kiss&rsquo;d it clingingly&mdash;(Ah,
why<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t women do these things in

I felt that if I lost her, I<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should not survive it:</p>

<p class="poetry">But this thought came ere yet I spake,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And froze the sentence on my lips:<br />
&ldquo;They err, who marry wives that make<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those little slips.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">It came like some familiar rhyme,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some copy to my boyhood set;<br />
And that&rsquo;s perhaps the reason I&rsquo;m<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unmarried yet.</p>
<p class="poetry">Would she have own&rsquo;d how pleased she

92</span>MOTHERHOOD.</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">She</span> laid it where
the sunbeams fall<br />
Unscann&rsquo;d upon the broken wall.<br />
Without a tear, without a groan,<br />
She laid it near a mighty stone,<br />

Thither in sport, long ages past,<br />
And Time with mosses had o&rsquo;erlaid,<br />
And fenced with many a tall grassblade,<br />
And all about bid roses bloom<br />
And violets shed their soft perfume.<br />
There, in its cool and quiet bed,<br />
She set her burden down and fled:<br />
Nor flung, all eager to escape,<br />

Swings as the elmtree waves his crest&mdash;<br />

class="pagenum">p. 106</span>But I&rsquo;ve managed, very
nearly,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To believe that I was dearly<br />
Loved by Somebody, who (blushing like a peach)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Flung it o&rsquo;er me saying, &ldquo;Wear it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For my sake&rdquo;&mdash;and I declare, it<br />
Seldom strikes me that I bought it on the beach.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see myself revealing<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unsuspected depths of feeling,<br />
As, in tones that half upbraid and half beseech,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I aver with what delight I<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Would give anything&mdash;my right eye&mdash;<br />
For a souvenir of our stroll upon the beach.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O! that eye that never
glisten&rsquo;d<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And that voice to which I&rsquo;ve listen&rsquo;d<br
/>
But in fancy, how I dote upon them each!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How regardless what o&rsquo;clock it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is, I pore upon that locket<br />
Which does not contain her portrait, on the beach!</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="page107"></a><span

&nbsp;&nbsp; I laboriously hide it,<br />
And a rather pretty sermon you might preach<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon Fantasy, selecting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For your &ldquo;instance&rdquo; the affecting<br />
Tale of me and my proceedings on the beach.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I depict her, ah, how
charming!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I portray myself alarming<br />
Herby swearing I would &ldquo;mount the deadly breach,&rdquo;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or engage in any scrimmage<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For a glimpse of her sweet image,<br />
Or her shadow, or her footprint on the beach.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I&rsquo;m ever ever
seeing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My imaginary Being,<br />
And I&rsquo;d rather that my marrowbones should bleach<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the winds, than that a cruel<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fate should snatch from me the jewel<br />
Which I bought for one and sixpence on the beach.</p>

<p class="poetry">Boats were curtseying, rising, bowing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (Boats in that climate are so polite),<br />

ours:&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">By rises that flush&rsquo;d with their purple

&nbsp;&nbsp; Thro&rsquo; becks that brattled o&rsquo;er grasses

We walked and waded, we two young shavers,<br />

<p class="poetry">We journeyed in parallels, I and Willie,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In fortunate parallels!&nbsp; Butterflies,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; As coal, some snowy (I ween) as curds;<br />

<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">You</span> see this
pebble-stone?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a thing I bought<br />
Of a bit of a chit of a boy i&rsquo; the mid o&rsquo; the
day&mdash;<br />
I like to dock the smaller parts-o&rsquo;-speech,<br />
As we curtail the already cur-tail&rsquo;d cur<br />

Did, rather, i&rsquo; the pre-Landseerian days.<br />

But there&rsquo;s a superstructure.&nbsp; Wait a bit.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of

  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
